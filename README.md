# Favorite Focal Length
Find out your favorite camera focal length by scanning all your photos.


## Quick Guide
1. Install exiftool https://exiftool.org/

2. Check out this repo

3. Make changes
   * **[imgFolders]** It can be a list of folders, but no need to include subfolders. (Subfolders are scanned automatically)
   * **[imgExtensions]** Add as needed
   * **[exiftoolPath]** Include the full path with .exe if running on Windows
   
4. Run
   * `python3 main.py`
   

## Suggestions
   * Python 3 is recommended.
   * Try to scan one camera at a time, or cameras with same sensor size.
   * **The focal length is not converted if it is not in 35mm.**

That says everything, and I do love wider angle. I bought the Sony 24GM for my A7R3. Loving it!
